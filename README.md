## Project Overview
Our backend is built using Strapi, a powerful headless CMS that enables easy content management and data modeling. It serves as the data source for our Next.js frontend, providing product information, and other crucial content.

## ‚ú® Features

- Strapi
- Postgres
- aws s3
- stripe
- graphql



### Data Models
We have set up various data models in Strapi to efficiently manage our e-commerce website's content. These models include Products, Categories, Reviews, and Repair Services, among others. Each model is designed to store the relevant information for smooth frontend functionality.

### API Endpoints
Strapi automatically generates RESTful APIs based on the defined data models. These APIs allow seamless communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring that product data, reviews, and other content are easily accessible.

### Authentication and Permissions
I have implemented user authentication and set appropriate permissions for different user roles. This ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive operations, such as adding new products or managing repair services.

## Getting Started

### Installation
To set up the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/nate-mal/strapi`
2. Change to the project directory: `cd strapi`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Configuration
Before running the backend, you'll need to configure some environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project.
2. Add the necessary environment variables, such as database credentials, MeiliSearch URL, and API secret.

Here's an example `.env` file:

```

```
3. Populate strapi with data using export_.... file (see strapi docs on using export/import)
4. Set up meilisearch and config strapi meiliseach plugin accordingly to cascade on data update (see meilisearch plugin page)
5. Set up google OAuth and update keys in strapi dashboard
